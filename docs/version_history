v0.1-beta.0

- Minimal gameplay achieved.
- Framerate independent movement.
- Hardware acceleration.
- Mouse and keyboard input implemented.
- Simple physics implemented.
- Load maps from plain text files.
- Simple graphics.

v0.1-beta.1
- Added coin rotation
- Game media paths are now stored inside the map files (not the source code).
- Added rotate map around the coin itself.
------------------
- Added a settings file.
- Added a simple menu structure with play and exit buttons. Operable with mouse and keyboard.
- Added fullscreen toggle.
- When line segments are next to each other, start and end forces are not applied. This makes the behaviour a little more realistic.
------------------
- Mouse sensibility is now included in settings.
- Pause button with pause image.
- Added basic win and lose scenes.
-----------------
- Added code for toggle buttons in the menu.
- Line segments can be drawn with textures.
- Map can include a rotating background.
- Added a simple camera management. Camera can be fixed, moved by the user, or follow the coin.

v0.1-beta.2
- Added infinite rotation possibility (when angle limit = 0).
- Added scale factor in map.
- Added a provisional (and parsimonious) menu to choose maps from.
- Added a new rotating type behaviour: rotate everything (including coin around the origin). Note: rotating around the coin seems unstable when angles are near 90ยบ (bad design), and the new mode seems to solve the problem
---------------------
- Added first sounds, music and sound options menu.
- Added pinball pop bumpers. Specified on map files, they make the ball bounce, and make a sound.
---------------------
- If the player rotates the map very fast (on "fixed point rotation"), this rotation can make the coin fly. 
  This makes the game much harder, so this is implemented as a gameplay option.
- Line segments can be invisible.
- Added a game option to limit speed to maximum one radius per frame. This is a workaround while the code to prevent the coin from going through the line segments.
- The game writes the options when closing to the settings file.
- Added a "no rotation" option for the map. When used, the map will not rotate.
- Added pinball flippers code. The pinball flippers can be specified on map file, and can be operated with the mouse buttons.

v0.2-beta.3
---------------------
- Added a countdown time system. Some maps can include it, and a countdown appears on the lower right part of the screen. When this counter reaches zero, the player loses.
- Added "round acceleration zones", that can be included in maps, and create an acceleration on the coin on a certain direction.
- Added a parameter to prevent coin rotation in some maps.
- Bugfixes in map loading functions in order to prevend segmentation faults and glibc errors, when maps are not correctly declared.
- Bugfix in loading texture function, related to transparency.
- Bugfix, flipper sound played during pause.
- Added a semi-transparent background for in game texts (to be able to see them with white backgrounds).
- Menu: checkboxes can now be clicked directly in the checkbox icon.
- Menu: Added code for numeric values setting. Added mouse sensitivity setting.
- Menu: Added a level select screen and the possibility to have separate level sets.
--------------------
- Bugfix: menu button data was not being freed correctly (caused double free glibc error on some menu layouts).
- Added a game logo in the welcome screen.
- Bugfix: countdown setting was not correctly managed. It worked due to "remaining memory garbage".
- Round acceleration zones can be set to non-visible, for aestethic reasons. This is used on "superpinball" map.
- Adjacency is not taken into account when the angle between two line segments is greater than a value. 
  This was intended to solve sticky behaviour in corners. While it does not addess the problem completely, i think it could be useful.
- Added a function to draw textures while keeping the original image aspect ratio. Three modes (stretch, original aspect ratio, original aspect ratio fill).
  Used this function to keep aspect ratio in game texts and menu elements. This makes game text a little more homogeneous (but still can be improved).
--------------------
- Added coin hit sounds. Volume is scalled depending on the energy the coin loses.
--------------------
- Added a "please wait while loading menu" screen, in order to make the game appear less "glitchy".
- Bugfix: in function that draws textures to screen, in fill mode.
- Disabled intro screen (but the code is still there, just in case it is needed in the future).
--------------------
- Simplified loadMainGameLoopMedia function call.
- Line segments texture can now be specified on level map file.
- Bugfix: pinball flipper display depended on wall texture size, instead of flipper texture size.
- Bugfix: memory for line segment textures was not being freed (memory leak).
- There is not number limit for level map components (segments, areas, bumpers, etc). Now only system memory and performance limit the maximum number of elements.  
- If the level icon image is not available, a new generic image is shown instead.
- Translate all comments into English.
---------------------
- Bugfix: coin hit sound. Worked under linux but not windows (abs<>fabs).
- Bugfix: level rotation makes coin fly. Different behavoiur between linux and windows (abs<>fabs).
- Bugfix: Calculate normal force to segment end (abs<>fabs)
