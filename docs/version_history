v0.1-beta.0

- Minimal gameplay achieved.
- Framerate independent movement.
- Hardware acceleration.
- Mouse and keyboard input implemented.
- Simple physics implemented.
- Load maps from plain text files.
- Simple graphics.

v0.1-beta.1
- Added coin rotation
- Game media paths are now stored inside the map files (not the source code).
- Added rotate map around the coin itself.
------------------
- Added a settings file.
- Added a simple menu structure with play and exit buttons. Operable with mouse and keyboard.
- Added fullscreen toggle.
- When line segments are next to each other, start and end forces are not applied. This makes the behaviour a little more realistic.
------------------
- Mouse sensibility is now included in settings.
- Pause button with pause image.
- Added basic win and lose scenes.
-----------------
- Added code for toggle buttons in the menu.
- Line segments can be drawn with textures.
- Map can include a rotating background.
- Added a simple camera management. Camera can be fixed, moved by the user, or follow the coin.

v0.1-beta.2
- Added infinite rotation possibility (when angle limit = 0).
- Added scale factor in map.
- Added a provisional (and parsimonious) menu to choose maps from.
- Added a new rotating type behaviour: rotate everything (including coin around the origin). Note: rotating around the coin seems unstable when angles are near 90ยบ (bad design), and the new mode seems to solve the problem
---------------------
- Added first sounds, music and sound options menu.
- Added pinball pop bumpers. Specified on map files, they make the ball bounce, and make a sound.
---------------------
- If the player rotates the map very fast (on "fixed point rotation"), this rotation can make the coin fly. 
  This makes the game much harder, so this is implemented as a gameplay option.
- Line segments can be invisible.
- Added a game option to limit speed to maximum one radius per frame. This is a workaround while the code to prevent the coin from going through the line segments.
- The game writes the options when closing to the settings file.
- Added a "no rotation" option for the map. When used, the map will not rotate.
- Added pinball flippers code. The pinball flippers can be specified on map file, and can be operated with the mouse buttons.
