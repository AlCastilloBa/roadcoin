v0.1-beta.0

- Minimal gameplay achieved.
- Framerate independent movement.
- Hardware acceleration.
- Mouse and keyboard input implemented.
- Simple physics implemented.
- Load maps from plain text files.
- Simple graphics.

v0.1-beta.1
- Added coin rotation
- Game media paths are now stored inside the map files (not the source code).
- Added rotate map around the coin itself.
------------------
- Added a settings file.
- Added a simple menu structure with play and exit buttons. Operable with mouse and keyboard.
- Added fullscreen toggle.
- When line segments are next to each other, start and end forces are not applied. This makes the behaviour a little more realistic.
------------------
- Mouse sensibility is now included in settings.
- Pause button with pause image.
- Added basic win and lose scenes.
-----------------
- Added code for toggle buttons in the menu.
- Line segments can be drawn with textures.
- Map can include a rotating background.
- Added a simple camera management. Camera can be fixed, moved by the user, or follow the coin.

v0.1-beta.2
- Added infinite rotation possibility (when angle limit = 0).
- Added scale factor in map.
- Added a provisional (and parsimonious) menu to choose maps from.
- Added a new rotating type behaviour: rotate everything (including coin around the origin). Note: rotating around the coin seems unstable when angles are near 90ยบ (bad design), and the new mode seems to solve the problem
